            "Watching Old Faithful Geyser erupt is a Yellowstone National Park tradition. People from all over the
            world have journeyed here to watch this famous geyser. The park’s wildlife and scenery might be as
            well-known today, but it was the unique thermal features like Old Faithful Geyser that inspired the
            establishment of Yellowstone as the world’s first national park in 1872.
            Old Faithful is one of nearly 500 geysers in Yellowstone and one of six that park rangers currently
            predict. It is uncommon to be able to predict geyser eruptions with regularity and Old Faithful has
            lived up to its name, only lengthening the time between eruptions by about 30 minutes in the last 30
            years.
            Thermal features change constantly and it is possible Old Faithful may stop erupting someday. Geysers
            and other thermal features are evidence of ongoing volcanic activity beneath the surface and change is
            part of this natural system. Yellowstone preserves the natural geologic processes so that visitors may
            continue to enjoy this natural system.
            Watch eruptions from the Old Faithful viewing area or along the boardwalks that weave around the geyser
            and through the Upper Geyser Basin." -

            "The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is roughly 20 miles long, measured from the Upper Falls to the Tower
            Fall area. The canyon was formed by erosion as Yellowstone River flowed over progressively softer, less
            resistant rock.The 109-foot (33.2-m) Upper Falls is upstream of the Lower Falls and can be seen from the
            Brink of the Upper Falls Trail and from Uncle Tom's Trail. The 308-foot (93.9-m) Lower Falls can be seen
            from Lookout Point, Red Rock Point, Artist Point, Brink of the Lower Falls Trail, and from various
            points on the South Rim Trail. The volume of water flowing over the falls can vary from 63,500 gallons
            (240,374 l)/second at peak runoff in the spring to 5,000 gallons (18,927 l)/second in the autumn. A third
            falls is located in the canyon between the Upper and Lower falls. Cascade Creek cascades into the canyon as
            Crystal Falls. It can be seen from the South Rim Trail just east of the Uncle Tom's area." -

        <h3 class="yellow-back">Lake Area</h3>
        <p class="yellow-back">

            "Situated at 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high elevation lake
            (above 7,000 feet / 2,134 m) in North America. It is roughly 20 miles (32.2 km) long and 14 miles (22.5
            km) wide, with 141 miles (227 km) of shoreline and a surface area of 132 square miles (342 km2).
            Yellowstone Lake freezes over completely every winter in late December or early January, with ice
            thicknesses varying from a few inches to more than two feet. The lake usually thaws in late May or early
            June. Yellowstone Lake remains cold year-round, with an average water temperature of 41°F (5°C). Because
            of the extremely cold water, swimming is not recommended. Survival time is estimated to be only 20 to 30
            minutes in water at this temperature. Yellowstone Lake has the largest population of wild cutthroat trout in
            North America. How a Pacific Ocean fish was trapped in a lake that drains to the Atlantic puzzled experts
            for years. Scientists now believe that Yellowstone Lake once drained to the Pacific Ocean via Outlet Canyon
            and the Snake River, and that fish swam across the Continental Divide at Two Ocean Pass. Lake trout, an
            illegally introduced, exotic species, is now found in Yellowstone Lake and threatens the existence of the
            native cutthroat trout.
            The lake currently drains north from its only outlet, the Yellowstone River, at Fishing Bridge. The
            elevation of the lake's north end does not drop substantially until LeHardy Rapids, so many consider those
            rapids to be the actual northern boundary of the lake." -
