                "Watching Old Faithful Geyser erupt is a Yellowstone National Park tradition. People from all over the
                world have journeyed here to watch this famous geyser. The park’s wildlife and scenery might be as
                well-known today, but it was the unique thermal features like Old Faithful Geyser that inspired the
                establishment of Yellowstone as the world’s first national park in 1872.
                The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is roughly 20 miles long, measured from the Upper Falls to the Tower
                Fall area. The canyon was formed by erosion as Yellowstone River flowed over progressively softer, less
                resistant rock.The 109-foot (33.2-m) Upper Falls is upstream of the Lower Falls and can be seen from the
                Brink of the Upper Falls Trail and from Uncle Tom's Trail.
                Situated at 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high elevation lake
                (above 7,000 feet / 2,134 m) in North America. It is roughly 20 miles (32.2 km) long and 14 miles (22.5
                km) wide, with 141 miles (227 km) of shoreline and a surface area of 132 square miles (342 km2).
                Yellowstone Lake freezes over completely every winter in late December or early January, with ice
                thicknesses varying from a few inches to more than two feet.
