                <p>Yellowstone is one of the largest active volcanoes in the world, has never erupted in human history,
                    and if it were to erupt, could flood the entire United States. Imagine a scene from the movie
                    "2012." The volcano erupts during an earthquake, causing a landslide, a tsunami and an "apocalypse."

                    This magical place attracts countless tourists who are fascinated by it, and that's why lots of
                    travlors came to the West. Yellowstone is the largest national park in the country, the first
                    national park in the world, and a UN World Heritage Site, among the most protected wildlife in the
                    United States. The park has hot springs, geysers, rivers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons, Old Faithful
                    Geyser, Grand Prismatic Hot Springs and Mammoth Hot Springs, all natural wonders.

                    The upper half of the park is mountainous and majestic, with the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone as the
                    main attraction, while the lower half is dominated by hot springs and is more beautiful with its
                    geysers, hot geysers, air jets and mud bubbling springs.
